# Hi, my name is Daniel McGovern.
I am a graduate of Athlone Institute of Technology, achieving First Class Honours in Software Design (Game) and I am looking to continue my work in the field of Software Design.

On this GitHub you will find college projects that challenged me during my studies, as well as new projects in development.
I am most interested in developing web applications, backend software and games in Unity.
I'm currently expanding my knowledge on languages and skills I gained in college (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB and more). 
I have also started learning RabbitMQ, an open source message broker.

If you wish to contact me, you may email me at danielmcgovern2@hotmail.com. [You may find my LinkedIn here.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-mcgovern-b4a34398/)
